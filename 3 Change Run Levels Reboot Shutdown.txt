			SHUTDOWN

IN runlevels 3 multiuser mode without NFS and it gives bunch of stuff 
        Trap Ctrl+Alt+Del--->for shoutdown
                ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now
        When ups is fail schedule a shutdown for 2 min
        	pf::powerfail:/sbin/shutdown -f -h +Z "Power Failure: System Shutting Down"
        Power Restored before Shutdown
        	pr::powerrokwait:/sbin/shutdown -c "Power Restored: Shutdown Cancalled"

		CD /ETC/INITTAB

Tells init what to do
set default runlevel
All commands in server process lives
cd /etc/init.d--->Inside init.d command line scripts used for different applications are present 
used to Sstart and Kstop things ./filename stop or ./filename start


			 /ETC/RC.D 

rc.d--->is used for referencing startup scripts
Different commands which run at different runlevel
	cat /etc/rc0.d
	cat /etc/rc1.d
	cat /etc/rc2.d
	cat /etc/rc3.d--->The scripts are all symbolic links whose targets are located in
/etc/init.d

			INIT.D

cd /etc/init.d
cd /etc/init.d/nfs S88nfs--->symbolioc link

				UPSTART
Upstart is an event-based replacement for the traditional init daemon 
Start and Stop a process in init file
cd /etc/init--->conf files
	normally we do --->services squid stop
		status squid 
		start squid
To Check which deamon process ara running
		initctl list | less



	Upstart is an event-based replacement for the traditional init daemon â€” the method by which several Unix-like computer operating systems perform tasks when the computer is started


	 Upstart is an event-based replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the system is running.

	It was originally develIE
