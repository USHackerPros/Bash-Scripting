			WHAT ARE SHARED LIBRARIES

Files that different binaries used
Different binary files links with the same library file it saves disk spaces becoz the library files does not have compiled into binary
Next is memory usage if there is a shared library loaded into memory ie two different program using the same library and loaded into memory second program is automatically loaded into memory
ldd command is used to see the shared libraries

				LDD,LD.SO.CONF.D

ldd--->(ldd /bin/ls) What library files where ls depends on--->help what the binary needs
ld.so.cache is in /etc--->Cache of all the library files currently installed on system
ld.so.conf---> Every configuration file in the ld.so.conf.d folder is included
ld.so.conf.d--->Four different conf files are present ld.so.conf.d all library conf files are stored  
ld.so.cache--->ls- l  read the cache file and update it all files are included in cache

ldconfig--->figure your system,
