						DETERMINE SETTINGS

					HAL--->HARDWARE ABSTRACTION LAYER

Imagine that a Server with 3 different Network Cards in it One is an intel card other free cam card 3rd is a diff type of card,some other OS like FREE BSD depending on the brand we have different device names how you refered them in our configuration. 
The HAL in Linux does when we pluged in an ethernet card in (Linux) knows it is an ethernet card it mention it as (eth0),
No matter wat type of card it is 
Abstracts out the idea what brand it is.
Great way to replace the material easier
eth0 abstract out the hardware which type it is. 
Abstracts out of the idea what brand the devices is, 

		    			DBUS--->Actual Bus(Communication between Haraware and Software)

Like Actual bus Kernel or HAL communicate with the Desktop
It is an actual bus.
dbus tells the Dsk by app and HAL
Manager or other removable or hardware(Communication with H/W and S/W)
Event signalling that a dbus signal has been emitted

					UDEV--->/dev/sda,/dev/sdb,/dev/sdc[Linux dynamic device management] 

All device information udev process is stored in the dev database.
Communicate by HAL wen a block devices is plugged in udev will find the device
/dev/sdb1 can be linked to /dev/camera
The udev daemon, udevd(8), receives device uevents directly from the kernel whenever a device is added or removed from the system, or it changes its state.

					SYSFS or /sys--->HAL keeps database all about the devices connected to hard drive


Generate and get filesystem type information cd /sys/bus HAL  is in sys directory 
       sysfs - get filesystem type information
HAL keep databases of devices which is connected to system
cd /sys/bus/usb/devices
cd /sys/bus/pci/devices

					PROC--->/proc---> Kernel keeps All the running commands

Its not a real filesystem itz not written to a hard disk
Dynamically Created in RAM when computer boots
All Source of different configurations are stored
Read and write information about the running krenel but only temperory
tf we make changes to proc file system in next reboot the changes will be gone
Must be root to make changes
It is a virtual filesystem
cd /proc--->mostly has process ID
	1--->is init process or first process
		cat cpuinfo--->Contain CPU information
		cat mounts ---->Currently mounted devices
cd /proc/sys/fs/---->All mounted file systems in computes
	cat file-max--->Maximum files opens at one time
		While running Oracle Database 500000 files can be very quick
		Changed by ( echo 1000000 > file-max ) 	
	and mounted devices and fs
cd /proc/sys/net/ipv4--->forward ip packets
	cat ip_forward--->view ip is forwarded or not
		to forward ip packets [echo 1 >ip_forward]	
		INFO of /proc stored in /etc/sysctl.conf
		
		cat /proc/cpuinfo

					DEV/dev--->device files UDEV

Created by UDEV
talks about hard drive and other devices which is connected
cd /dev
cdrom--->which type of cdrom it is udev will say
udev rules
		
					LSMOD

lsmod--->Shows kernal module currently running in system

					LSUSB

lsusb---->Current USB devices connected
		
					LSPCI

lspci--->Current PCI devices pluged into computer
lspcmcia
lshal
lshw
			
					KERNEL MODULE
	
(lsmod vmxnet) for network module
rmmod modulename--->remove kernal module
insmod modulename--->insert module into running kernel for packages
modprobe--->it is also insert module probes for any other dependencies and insert the module
nano /etc/modules/--->edit module to make permanent changes
or
cd /etc/modprobe.d

					CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
					
			UUID(Universal Unique IDentifier)---->Used to mount hard drive or devices in a specific place
		
Used to mount hard drive or devices in a specific place for example one in /home other in /root, /var
Mount specific folder based on UUID
Instead of specifing specific device /dev/sdb1
Set Device ID	
UUID--->device ID UUID(Universially Unique ID)
Mount a hard drive or flash drive based on its exact unique identifier



					ADDING AND REMOVING DEVICES

Happens in dev directory

Hard Plug--->Plug an usb device when system is running 
Cold plug--->Turnoff the system and then use the Video Card or others
